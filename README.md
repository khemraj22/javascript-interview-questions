## Q. ***What is Node.js?***

Node.js is an open-source server side runtime environment built on Chrome\'s V8 JavaScript engine. It provides an event driven, non-blocking (asynchronous) I/O and cross-platform runtime environment for building highly scalable server-side applications using JavaScript.

## Q. ***What are the benefits of using Node.js?***

From a web server development perspective Node has a number of benefits:

  * Great performance! Node was designed to optimize throughput and scalability in web applications and is a good solution for many common web-development problems (e.g. real-time web applications).

  * Code is written in "plain old JavaScript", which means that less time is spent dealing with "context shift" between languages when you're writing both client-side and server-side code. 

  * JavaScript is a relatively new programming languages and benefits from improvements in language design when compared to other traditional web-server languages (e.g. Python, PHP,  etc.) Many other new and pouplar languages compile/convert into JavaScript so you can use TypeScript, CoffeeScript, ClojureScript, Scala, LiveScript, etc.

  * The node package manager (NPM) provides access to hundres of thousands of resuable packages. It also has best-in-class dependency resolution and can also be used to automate most of the build toolchain.

  * Node.js is portable. It is available on Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, Solaris, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, WebOS, and NonStop OS. Furthermore, it is well-supported by many web hosting providers, that often provide specific infrastrucutre and documentation for hosting 
    Node sites.

  * It has a very active third party ecosystem and developer community, with lots of people who are willing to help.
